                Dr. G. Viswanathan, the founder-chancellor of VIT University,
                was born on December 8, 1938 in a remote village near Vellore in
                Tamil Nadu. Dr. G. Viswanathan life is a source of inspiration
                to the aspiring youth.
                <br /> <br />
                <b>Dr. G. Viswanathan</b> − The Student
                <br />
                Dr. G. Viswanathan completed Advanced Management Program at
                Harvard Business School in 2003, nearly four decades after his
                University education, reaffirming his fervour in being an
                eternal student. He excelled in academics right from his
                childhood. His early education was confined to his small village
                where he studied in Tamil - his mother tongue. His
                pre-university education at Voorhees College, Vellore initiated
                him to the world outside. From there he moved on to obtain his
                Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Economics from the prestigious
                Loyola College, Chennai. Following this, he graduated in Law
                from Madras Law College.

                <b>Dr. G. Viswanathan</b> − The Leader of the People
                <br />
                A student leader in his twenties entering Indian parliament was
                something incredible, especially in 1960s. But it was Dr. G.
                Viswanathan who championed people’s issues in the parliament and
                they, in turn, reposed faith in the leader who fulfilled their
                expectations. They re-elected him by a bigger margin in the next
                election for another five-year term. He travelled to different
                parts of the world as a member of parliamentary delegations and
                appreciated issues in a global perspective. Dr. G. Viswanathan
                wanted to play a bigger role in the provincial politics in order
                to make a direct contribution in bettering the lives of the
                people in the region. He was elected to Tamil Nadu Legislative
                Assembly for ten years. During this period, he served as a
                Minister for two years.

                <b>Dr. G. Viswanathan</b> − The Educator <br />
                Dr. G. Viswanathan founded Vellore Engineering College in 1984
                at Vellore. He envisioned that this Institution would offer
                World-Class Education to students who would in turn create an
                indelible impact on the society. The engineering college that
                started with an intake of 180 students in 1984 has evolved as a
                university with four campuses. Over 25,000 students are enrolled
                in 51 undergraduate and 33 Postgraduate, 11 Integrated, 2
                Research programmes and 2 M.Tech Industrial Programmes with
                nearly 16,000 residing on the campus. It attracts students and
                professors from different parts of the world. It houses more
                than 1000 international students on campus. For the past two
                years, VIT University has been ranked #1 private engineering
                institution in India. ISO Certification from Holland,
                International accreditation from the United Kingdom and USA, and
                the highest accreditation grade from the Government of India
                reflect the University’s penchant for excellence on all fronts.

                <b>Dr. G. Viswanathan</b> − The Institution <br />
                Due to his passion for societal development and compassion for
                the underprivileged, Mr. GV has launched several schemes for
                uplifting the women and unemployed youth in the region to help
                them become self-reliant. He offers scholarships to students
                from disadvantaged sections of the society to enable them to
                pursue higher education. He has established the Universal Higher
                Education Trust to create opportunities for higher education to
                every deserving student in the region. He has adopted several
                villages with the motto of improving the quality of lives of the
                rural people. His vision of transforming Vellore into a greener
                and cooler town by planting one million saplings has begun to
                yield fruit. Mr. GV’s farsightedness extends beyond horizons.

                Strategy (transmission of high-standard education resulting from

                Collaboration and International-regional Cooperation Strategy
                (promoting regional cooperation from Yokohama and Kanagawa to

                Pro-Chancellor of a University in the world, which has been
                recognized by the Limca Book of Records, 2005. He holds a
                postgraduate degree in Business Administration from University
                of Madras. Dr. Selvam became the first Vice-President of VIT
                Chennai in 2010, where he sculptured the campus from the
                scratch. The high rise structures, the lush green ambience and
                the ultra-modern infrastructure that adorn VIT Chennai were
                created within a short span of time under his able leadership.
                He has developed VIT Chennai campus in conformity with the
                standards of the Green LEED certification. As the Vice
                President, he continues to contribute diligently to its growth.
                His painstaking efforts in implementing several innovative
                measures have enabled VIT to emerge as an institution of
                international eminence. A self-motivated and industrious person,
                and a farsighted educationalist, Dr G V Selvam possesses an
                innate ability to spot and nurture talent–be it with the
                faculty, staff or students. He offers flexible and pragmatic
                academic solutions not only for toppers but also for slow
                learners. Dr. Selvam was instrumental in introducing new and
                need-based programmes of study such as Law, Architecture, Hotel
                Management and Agriculture. He introduced the inter-university
                sports & cultural extravaganza, “Riviera”, which has blossomed
                into an acclaimed international event. He played a significant
                role in establishing the VIT Technology Business Incubator
                (VITTBI), which has received national acclaim for its service to
                budding entrepreneurs. The Centre for Sustainable Rural
                Development and Research Studies [CSRD&RS] is the brainchild of
                Dr G V Selvam. The centre is working towards providing urban
                facilities in rural areas to enhance the living conditions in
                villages, which would develop the rural folk on par with the
                urban people in terms of education and employability. A man with
                a deep passion for nature, Dr. G V Selvam takes immense interest
                in green initiatives. The lush green, self-sustaining, VIT
                campuses in Vellore and Chennai are examples of his efforts to
                adorn the spaces with natural beauty. He is the brain behind the
                Green Vellore Project, which has added green cover to the rocky
                and barren landscape of Vellore, and the Clean Palar Project,
                which is taking measures to restore the Palar river bed to its
                original texture. He is passionate about transforming Vellore
                into a clean, green and nature-rich city. Dr. Selvam is inspired
                and guided by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam’s principle: “A leader must
                have vision and passion, and not be afraid of any problem.
                Instead, he should know how to defeat it. Most importantly, he
                must work with integrity.”
